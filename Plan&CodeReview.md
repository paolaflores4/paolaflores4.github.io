# Refinement Plan
## 1. Software Engineering & Design
For the first category, I chose to work with my IT 135 Object Orient Analysis/Design Final Project. My plan to enhance this artifact is to upgrade the design of this program and add more functionalities. I will add a new function which will demonstrate my abilities in the design of a software.

## 2. Algorithms and Data Structures
For the second category, I chose to work with my IT 145 Found In App Development Final Project. The original project consists of a software for a Zoo to monitor animals and habitats which has been written in Java. My plan is to enhance this program by adding a new role "Veterinary" to be able to keep track of the animal's check ups and when will be the next one. This enhancement will demonstrate my abilities using and creating algorithms and data structures to store & access information.

## 3. Databases
For the third category, I chose to work with the DAT 220 Fundamentals of Data Mining Final Project. The original document consists of an analysis based on the interpretation of data from graphics and trends. For this enhancement I will work with the same data using SQL to interpret and manage it. This enhancement will demonstrate my ability to work with databases and SQL.
