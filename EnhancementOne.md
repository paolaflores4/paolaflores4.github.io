# Enhancement One
## Software Engineering & Design

The artifact chosen for the Software Engineering & Design enhancements was my IT 135 Object Orient Analysis/Design Final Project which was created in March 2020. This project was made with the purpose to demonstrate my abilities designing a program and using Use Case descriptions. The purpose of this project was to create a Student Information System to which Enrollment Staff and Students had access to.

I chose to include this artifact in this e-Portfoltio because it demonstrates my abilities in software design. Another reason I chose to include this artifact is because I found that there were other possibilities and capabilities that the software could have and that could help demonstrate my abilities. The enhancement I chose for this artifact was to expand the capabilities of the program. The main function is to maintain student records but Enrollment Staff needs to provide the information to the system (names, grades, etc.) in order for students to be able to access their information. The enhancement consists of allowing Enrollment Staff to make students reports automatically from the system. It is good to have the information available through the system but it is usefull too to be able to print those reports if requested.

Before doing the enhancements I revisited the project to refresh what the main purpose was and be able to propose new functionalities that could be found useful.
