# e-Portfolio 

## Introduction
This e-Portfolio has been developed in the Computer Science Capstone Course. My name is Paola Flores and I've been in the SNHU Computer Science Program since 2018. I graduated from Business Administration in 2014 but what I have been always passionate about is technology so in 2018 I decided to go back to school and enroll in the Bachelor in Computer Science program with a concentration in Software Engineering.

## e-Portfolio Summary
Througout the BS in Computer Science program I have taken different courses that have helped me acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to be here today and being able to do the activities needed to complete this Capstone. The main topics are related to algorithms and data structures, databases and software design. 

For the final Capstone we had to select three projects that we had previously made in the other classes and make some enhancements in order to prove what we have been learning. These three artifacts represent what I have learned, demonstrate my techniques and most of all, the start of a wonderful career in the technology field.
