# Enhancement Two
## Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact chosen for the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancements was my IT 145 Found In App Development Final Project which was created in April 2019. This project was made with the purpose to demonstrate my abilities programming in java. The purpose of this code was to develop a software to help a Zoo monitor their animals and habitats. 

I chose to include this artifact in this e-Portfoltio because it demonstrates my abilities in programming, logic thinking and development & design. Another reason I chose to include this artifact is because I found that, with the knowledge I have now, there were so many enhancements that could've been done to it and so many possibilities. The enhancement I chose for this artifact was to expand the possibilities that this software could have and included a new option for Veterinary. Part of designing softwares is to be able to propose solutions to people's issues, in this case the issue was that the Zoo didn't have a program to monitor animals and habitats and it was created, but then another problem came to mind. How do you keep track o animal's health? Because of this question I found that a new option must be available for veterinaries to be able to track the last check up and the next one. In this project it is evident the use of algorithms to establish the instructions the program had to follow to perform what was desired by the user and the understanding of data structures which were evident in the storage of information needed by the software.

Before doing the enhancements I had to revisit the old project and remember some aspects about the main issue in order to be able to propose new solutions. This is important when designing a software, you have to get to know the project and understand the **why** of it to be able to do a good job and provide the instructions that will do what we are asking the program to do.
