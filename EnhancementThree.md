# Enhancement Three
## Databases

For the third category, I chose to work with the DAT 220 Fundamentals of Data Mining Final Project and was created in December 2019. The data for this project was originally for data mining using JMP to help analyze it. This program uses the collected data and manipulates it which results in graphics and numbers that will help you interpret the data and establish if there's a trend somewhere. I planned to enhance this artifact using SQL to demonstrate that it is possible to get data quicker using other languages and tools.

I chose to include this artifact because it allows me to demonstrate my capabilities using SQL and practice even more. The final project for this class was to build a report containing the analysis that was made from what the JMP application allowed me to use. This enhancement involves new things for me since I have been using other tools for data managing and being able to use SQL to manipulate databases has opened up a new world of possibilities.
